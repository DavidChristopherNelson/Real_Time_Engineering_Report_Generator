# Class Map
Panels
* Panels have four edges
* Panels have an absolute location
* Panels have an orientation
"panel_1": {
  [edge_1, edge_2, edge_3, edge_4],
  absolute_location_1,
  Orientation.FLOOR
}
tests
* Panels have four edges.
* Panel's location is absolute not relative.

Edges
* Edges belong to a Panel
* Edges have two corner nodes
* Edges have one or two connector nodes
* The corner nodes must be located multiples of 1.2m from each other
* The connector nodes must be located 0.6m awa from the corner nodes
* The connector nodes must be located on the geometric line between corner 
  nodes
"edge_1": {
  [corner_node_1, corner_node_2],
  [connector_node_1, connector_node_2]
}

Nodes
* Belong to an Edge
* Have a location that may be None

CornerNodes
* Inherits from Nodes
* Can connect with one other corner node which must also connect with them
tests
* Corner nodes cannot connect with themselves.
* Corner nodes cannot connect with other corners that belong to the same 
  edge.
* Corner nodes cannot connect with other corners that belong to a different
  panel. 

ConnectorNodes
* Inherits from Nodes
* Can connect with one other connector node which must also connect with them
"connector_node_1": {
  relative_location_1,
  connector_node_2
}
tests
* Connector nodes cannot connect with themselves.
* Connector nodes cannot connect with other connectors that belong to the same 
  edge.
* Connector nodes cannot connect with other connectors that belong to the same 
  panel.

Location
* Has x, y and z variables that are either all set to floating point numbers
  or are all set to None.
* The x, y and z values can be returned and changed.
location_1 = {
  "x": None,
  "y": None,
  "z": None
}
tests
* Either x, y and z are all floating point or they are all None. 

RelativeLocation
* Inherits from Location
* Belongs to a node
relative_location_1 = {
  "x": None,
  "y": None,
  "z": None,
  connector_node_1
}
tests
* Cannot be allocated to a panel.

AbsoluteLocation
* Inherits from Location
* Belongs to a panel
relative_location_1 = {
  "x": None,
  "y": None,
  "z": None,
  panel_1
}
tests
* Cannot be allocated to a node.

Orientation
* Has three options "floor", "wall" and "roof"
class Orientation(Enum):
    FLOOR = "floor"
    WALL = "wall"
    ROOF = "roof"

Orientation.FLOOR
